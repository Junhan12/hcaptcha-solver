## Key Principle

Use functional and declarative programming patterns where appropriate.

Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).

Always check the existing codebase before creating new names, files, or classes — never hallucinate.

When uncertain about existing code, ask for repository context before proceeding.


## Python convention

Keep line length ≤ 80 characters where practical.

Use log() instead of print() for debugging.

## Comments & Documentation

Use multi-line comments every 3–6 lines for complex logic.

Explain the “why”, not just the “what”.

Do not include AI attribution.

## Debugging Workflow

Debug logically and systematically.

Add log() statements temporarily to inspect behavior.

Avoid repeating failed approaches — try new ones.

Clean up debugging code after fixes.

## Refactoring & Preservation

Preserve original functionality unless explicitly requested to change.

Double-check behavior before removing or modifying logic.

## For large changes:

Provide before/after comparison.

Include regression tests.

Document rollback options.

Use a direct, confident, and concise tone.

No fluff — every word intentional.

Use light humor or wit only when appropriate, never at the cost of clarity.

## For code work:

List changed files

Describe rationale

Provide test or verification steps

## Closing

If project-specific conventions differ, confirm and follow them.

When uncertain: search the repo or ask.
